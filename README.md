This will be downloaded files for the open-source project, Farmbot.

Hi SOAR Team,

This is a basic repository so that we may practice using the varous GitHub features. I would say practice making a branch to my repository and then iniate a Pull Request. Finally, merge them into the master branch. This is easy once you make your account and use the tutorial.


This will be a quick task so that we can assure we are comfortable performing basic GitHub operations.

Example:
Hi, I'm Chrisian. I have successfully created a branch, committed a pull request, and then merged request with Master. With the new updated changes, I deleted the branch I used to make this edit. Try it out!
